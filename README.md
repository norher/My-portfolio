Applying Advaced CSS to HTML

This is my personal professional portfolio.

This is my homework assigned to me on an even numbered week, meaning this code was all written from scratch. FROM SCRATCH!

I tried to stay true to who I am and made a color theme around my favorite colors, green and orange. I made it darker for readability but also for a nice composed and simple appearance. 

This is a single page application.

In the header there is a picture of me along with a nav with links to the various sections of the application.

The links include an about me section, some of my works and how to contact me.

I followed semantic HTML for all of my index.html file. 

There's a simple but eye-catching introdction of myself. 

In the main section there's some information about me.

After that a picture of all my projects with descriptions, and when you click on any of the pictures it takes to the live application of that individual application.

The images grow when the mouse is hovered over them.

At the end there's links to my social media and a link to email me directly.

This application is responsive for various types of screens.

Some of the features that are changed are the size of the pictures. The color of my header borders and the direction of my nav and my contact a tags

Finally, on the footer is what will probably be my default footer from now on.
